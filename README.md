###App-DNS-Adblock

This is a DNS server that functions as an ad blocking proxy. It loads [maintained lists](http://adblockplus.org/en/subscriptions) of ad hosts intended for use by the Adblock Plus Firefox extension. It is a lighter, non-Moose version of Net::DNS::Dynamic::Adfilter.

See [App::DNS::Adblock](http://search.cpan.org/~dwatson/App-DNS-Adblock/) on the CPAN for details.
