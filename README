App::DNS::Adblock - A DNS implementation of Adblock Plus

This is a DNS server intended for use as an ad filter for a local area network.
Its function is to load lists of ad domains and nullify DNS queries for those
domains to the loopback address.

The module loads externally maintained lists of ad hosts intended for use by
Adblock Plus, a popular ad filtering extension for the Firefox browser. A 
locally maintained blacklist/whitelist can also be loaded.

Once running, local network dns queries can be addressed to the host's ip. This
ip is echoed to stdout.

See sample script: scripts/adfilter.pl
